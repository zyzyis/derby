<h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>

<p>
These notes describe the difference between Derby release 10.2.2.0
and the preceding release, 10.2.1.6. 10.2.2.0 is a bug-fix release.  It includes compiled
      versions of Derby's JDBC4 drivers, which appeared in the
      previous release only as source code.
In addition, 10.2.2.0 includes a number of
<a href="#Bug Fixes">bug fixes</a>
not found in the previous release. No new features appear in 10.2.2.0.

<h2><a name="Issues"></a>Issues</h2>

<p>
Applications which run against Derby 10.0 or 10.1 may rely on
      incorrect Derby behavior. After upgrading to 10.2, those
      applications may need some recoding so that they no longer rely
      on bad behavior which has been fixed. Please consult the
      following list of issues which may require some application recoding.
Note that 10.2.2.0 does not introduce any additional issues beyond the
      issues introduced by 10.2.1.6:

<a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-253">DERBY-253</a>
</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>
PreparedStatement.setUnicodeStream() and ResultSet.getUnicodeStream()
throw SQLException when invoked after upgrading to Apache Derby 10.2.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Symptoms</h4>
<p>
Calling either of these methods will result in an exception with
SQLSTATE 0A000 and message: "Feature not implemented: ..."
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>
PreparedStatement.setUnicodeStream() and ResultSet.getUnicodeStream()
have been deprecated since JDBC 2.0. Derby's implemetation of these
methods was broken, and it was decided that the methods should throw a
not-implemented exception instead of being fixed.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
This was an intentional change. No Derby product solution is offered.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Workaround</h4>
<p>
Use setCharacterStream() and getCharacterStream() instead of
setUnicodeStream() and getUnicodeStream().
</p>
</blockquote>

<a name="668"></a>
<a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-668">DERBY-668</a>
</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>
Sysinfo needs special permissions when run under a Java security manager.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Symptoms</h4>
<p>
If you do not provide these permissions, you will see a message such as the following in your sysinfo output: Unable to analyze class path: access denied (java.util.PropertyPermission java.class.path read).
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>
Such a message does not indicate an error; it simply means that the sysinfo tool was unable to provide detailed classpath information because it did not have permission to read the classpath. In prior releases, under these circumstances, sysinfo would silently print nothing, now it prints an informational message about the reason that it couldn't provide any classpath information.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
The sysinfo tool now prints additional information about the
origin of the classes and jars that it examines. The origin
of a class might be: an entry in the application classpath,
an entry in a class loader location
list, a jar fetched due to being listed in the manifest entry
of another jar, a standard extension in the JRE's extensions
directory, a jar installed into the application server,
or any of various other possibilities.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Workaround</h4>
<p>
Grant these permissions so that sysinfo can run correctly under the
        Java security manager.
</p>

<blockquote>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>
Behavior has changed for applications which open two InputStreams on the
          same ResultSet column.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Symptoms</h4>
<p>
Undefined results were returned to an application which
opened an InputStream twice on the same column of a ResultSet.
The value siphoned out of the column was erratic.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>
Streams were being shared between the two readers.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
Now we throw an exception if the application tries to open
two streams on the same column in a ResultSet.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Workaround</h4>
<p>
Users must recode Applications which open
 multiple streams on the same column.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="781"></a>
<a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-781">DERBY-781</a>
</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>
Compilation times may increase for queries which have subqueries in
        the FROM clause.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Symptoms</h4>
<p>
Execution performance of queries containing non-flattenable subqueries may change. The expectation is that the new (10.2) query plans will show improved performance over the old ones.
</p>
<p>
Another potential symptom is that the compilation time for such queries may increase. If this happens, the increase should only occur at compilation time; execution time should either improve or, at the very least, remain the same as in earlier versions of Derby.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>
If the optimizer chooses to do a hash join with a subquery, Derby only has to execute the subquery a single time per statement, after which Derby can just perform the desired join against the materialized result set. Depending on how many rows are in the outer table of the join, this once-per-statement execution of the subquery can lead to major performance improvements over the once-per-outer-row execution employed by earlier versions of Derby.
</p>
<p>
As for the extra compilation time, this is due to the simple fact that the optimizer is now doing more work--i.e. in addition to considering nested loop joins with subqueries, it is now _also_ considering hash joins with those subqueries, and that means that it could potentially take longer for the optimizer to finish its work. Note again that, if it occurs, the increased time should only occur at compilation time; execution time should either improve or, at the very least, remain the same as in earlier versions of Derby.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
This was an intentional change to improve the execution plans chosen by the optimizer for queries having large and/or complex subqueries. The expectation is that the new behavior--and the subsequent query plans--will lead to improved performance over the old ones, so no further solution is required.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Workaround</h4>
<p>
There is no way to disable/workaround this new behavior. The increased
        compilation time buys better performance at query execution time.
</p>
<p>
That said, any user who notices a negative performance change after
moving to Derby 10.2, and who believes that the difference in
performance is related to this optimizer enhancement, is encouraged to
visit the
<a href="http://wiki.apache.org/db-derby/PerformanceDiagnosisTips">performance diagnosis page</a>
and to follow up with his/her findings on the Derby mailing lists.

<h3>
<a name="822"></a>
<a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-822">DERBY-822</a>
</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>
Queries may fail earlier and locks may be acquired earlier when
executing queries. Location where errors occur in an embedded
environment is different from the location where errors occur in a
network environment.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Symptoms</h4>
<p>
Errors that happen as part of the normal execution path are moved earlier. For example, code to execute a query, with executeQuery() retrieve the result set metadata and then perform a next() might fail with a lock timeout on executeQuery() instead of next(). Locking changes are observed.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>
Pre-fetching moves execution of retrieval of data earlier for network client/server configurations.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
This was an intentional behavior change to improve performance. No Derby product solution is offered.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Workaround</h4>
<p>
Application code needs to be changed to adjust error handling if
needed. 
</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>
When using Derby's client DataSources, you can no longer set the database name using
          setConnectionAttributes().
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Symptoms</h4>
<p>
Derby's client DataSources were using a wrong database name when
getting a connection in the following case:
</p>

<ul>
<li>databaseName is not set as a Derby DataSource property</li>
<li>databaseName is set as a connection attribute using
setConnectionAttributes method</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>
Instead of throwing an exception saying databaseName is a required Derby DataSource property and must be set, client driver was using "null" as database name and returning a connection to database named "null".
The database name was constructed wrongly in the client driver.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
This was solved by setting the internal database name property in the client driver correctly. Also ensured that databaseName set as a connection attribute will not be used by Derby's client DataSources.. This fix will be available in Derby versions 10.2 and above.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Workaround</h4>
<p>
When upgrading an application to run against Derby 10.2, make sure the
        database name is set
only as a DataSource property when using Derby's client DataSources.
</p>

<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>
Result sets of type TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE no longer implicitly close
when positioned at the end in autocommit mode.
</p>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Symptoms</h4>
<p>
Calling the ResultSet.next() method when positioned on the last row of
a result set of type SCROLL_INSENSITIVE in auto commit mode used to cause the result set to be closed.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>
The JDBC specification allows a JDBC driver to implicitly close a
ResultSet when the ResultSet type is TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY and the next
method of ResultSet returns false. Derby also used to implicitly close result sets of type SCROLL_INSENSITIVE when the ResultSet.next() method returns false in auto commit mode.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
The behavior of SCROLL_INSENSITIVE result sets in auto commit mode has
been changed to comply with the JDBC4
specification. SCROLL_INSENSITIVE result sets are not implicitly
closed when calling the ResultSet.next() method in auto commit mode
while positioned on the last row. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Workaround</h4>
<p>
Fix applications which rely on the previous, non-standard behavior.

<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>
The return values of executeQuery() and executeUpdate() have changed
            for the Derby network client.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Symptoms</h4>
<p>
The behaviour of executeQuery() and executeUpdate() did not match the
JDBC specification when invoking stored procedures.
</p>
<ul>
<li> When invoking a stored procedure with executeQuery() or
    executeUpdate(), an exception was thrown indicating that the
    procedure did not return the correct number of ResultSet objects,
    although the correct number of ResultSet objects was in fact
    returned.
</li>
<li> When invoking a stored procedure with executeQuery() or
    executeUpdate(), and the procedure did not return the correct
    number of ResultSet objects, the query executed successfully.
</li>
<li> With the network client driver, when invoking a stored procedure
    with executeUpdate(), the return value was -1, whereas the JDBC
    specification says it should be 0.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>
The methods executeQuery() and executeUpdate() were not implemented in
compliance with the JDBC specification.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
In Derby 10.2, the behaviour of the methods executeQuery() and
executeUpdate() has been changed to match the JDBC specification.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Workaround</h4>
<p>
Use execute() instead of executeUpdate()/executeQuery() to invoke a
stored procedure which does not return exactly 0 or 1 ResultSet
objects.

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>
Calls to rowUpdated(), rowDeleted(), and rowInserted() now forbidden
on unpositioned, forward-only ResultSets.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Symptoms</h4>
<p>
For a JDBC ResultSet with type TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY, the methods
rowUpdated, rowDeleted and rowInserted could previously be called
while not on a row, i.e. before positioning in the result set, while
on insertRow, after updateRow before new positioning, after deleteRow
before new positioning and when after last row. This is now
disallowed.
</p>
<p>
Calls to any of these methods while not on a row will now throw
SQLException with SQLState 24000.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>
Derby now disallows these calls when not on a row.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
Change the application to not call these methods unless on a row. Note
that using them at all is rather meaningless for a ResultSet of type
TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY since the returned result will always be 'false'.
This is because once you modify a row, it can no longer be accessed,
you need to move to the next row, if there is one, to get a new
current row. Presently in Derby, these methods are only really
meaningfully used for result sets of type TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE and
of concurrency CONCUR_UPDATABLE in which case updated and deleted rows
can be detected.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Workaround</h4>
<p>
Fix applications which rely on this non-standard behavior.

<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>
Performance may change for queries with nested subqueries and/or large
        FROM clauses.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Symptoms</h4>
<p>
Execution performance of large queries (esp. those with nested subqueries and/or with large FROM clauses) may change. The expectation is that the new (10.2) query plans will show improved performance over the old ones.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>
Since the optimizer is now spending less time evaluating sub-optimal join orders, it is possible that it will be able to try out more join orders before optimizer "timeout" occurs. As a result the optimizer can sometimes find better plans than it did in earlier versions of Derby.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
This was an intentional change to fix behavior that was not working correctly in earlier versions of Derby. The expectation is that the new behavior--and the subsequent query plans--will lead to improved performance over the old ones, so no further solution is required.

In general, the performance of these queries should stay the same or
        improve. However, it is possible that performance may degrade
        for some queries.
Any user who notices a negative performance change after
moving to Derby 10.2, and who believes that the difference in
performance is related to this optimizer change, is encouraged to
visit the
<a href="http://wiki.apache.org/db-derby/PerformanceDiagnosisTips">performance diagnosis page</a>
and to follow up with his/her findings on the Derby mailing lists.

</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>
Maximum BLOB/CLOB length has increased to 2G-1.
</p>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Symptoms</h4>
<p>
Previously, Derby rejected BLOB lengths greater than 1M.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>
The allowable size of Derby LOBs has been increased.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
This was an intentional change to make Derby conform to its own
documentation.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Workaround</h4>
<p>
Fix applications which rely on Derby rejecting LOBs that are bigger
than 1M.
</p>

<blockquote>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>
Recursive trigger firing disallowed.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Symptoms</h4>
<p>
In some cases, an after update trigger does not get fired upon itself when its trigger action contains
an update statement on the trigger's subject table.
</p>
<p>
(1) When defining a trigger for the first time for a table, e.g.:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>  
        CREATE TABLE "TEST" ("TESTID" INTEGER NOT NULL GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY (START WITH 1, INCREMENT BY 1),
                             "INFO" INTEGER NOT NULL,
                             "TIMESTAMP" TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT '1980-01-01-00.00.00.000000');
    
        CREATE TRIGGER UPDATE_TEST
        AFTER UPDATE ON TEST
        REFERENCING OLD AS OLD
        FOR EACH ROW MODE DB2SQL
            UPDATE TEST SET TIMESTAMP = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE TESTID = OLD.TESTID;
  
        INSERT INTO TEST (INFO) VALUES (1), (2), (3);

        UPDATE TEST SET INFO = 1 WHERE TESTID = 2;
</pre></blockquote>


<p>
The above update statement executes successfully which it is incorrect. The system should have issued
SQLSTATE 54038 since it self-triggers to its maximum depth of 16.
</p>

   
<p>
(2) With the above example, when an user upgrades to a higher version and issues the same update statement:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
        UPDATE TEST SET INFO = 1 WHERE TESTID = 2;
        ERROR 54038: Maximum depth of nested triggers was exceeded.
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The SQLSTATE 54038 is issued in this case because after database upgrade, the trigger action will be
invalidated by the system and will force a recompilation of the trigger when it is fired. The system
generates the correct execution plan this time and since the trigger behavior have changed, this might
cause applications to break unexpectedly.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>
Derby did not generate the correct execution plan for self-trigger invocation when such a trigger is declared
for the first time on the subject table; hence, resulting in the stated problem above. The affected version is
Derby 10.0 and 10.1.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
This behavior has been corrected in 10.2.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Workaround</h4>
<p>
If self-trigger invocation was not intended by the application, the application can select which column(s) on the
update statement can cause the trigger to fire in the CREATE TRIGGER statement. i.e.:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
   CREATE TRIGGER update_test
   AFTER UPDATE OF INFO ON test
   REFERENCING OLD AS old
   FOR EACH ROW MODE DB2SQL
       UPDATE test SET timestamp=current_timestamp WHERE testid=old.testid;
</pre></blockquote>
 
<p>
In the above statement, the trigger will only fire when an update
is made to the "info" column instead of any column(s).

<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>
With IBM 1.4.1 JVM, trying to connect to the server using the derby client with security mechanism 8 (USRSSSBPWD) will result in error.
</p>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Symptoms</h4>
<p>
Connecting using the client driver with security mechanism 8 will throw the following error
ERROR XJ112: Security exception encountered, see next exception for details.
The stack trace will show that the problem is caused by java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException: SHA1PRNG SecureRandom not available
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>
Current USRSSBPWD implementation uses SHA1PRNG algorithm to generate random number(seed) that gets exchanged between client and the server. The SHA1PRNG algorithm is not available with the JCE provider that comes with IBM JVM version 1.4.1.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
You must use another JCE provider.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Workaround</h4>
<p>
If you need to use the security mechanism 8, then make sure that support for SHA1PRNG is available in the JCE provider that is available with a particular JVM.
For e.g. Use IBM 1.4.2 JVM that has support for SHA1PRNG or the Sun JVMs.
